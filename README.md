# E-commerce_Data_Analytics

In this project, I use SQL, Python, and Tableau to help the global superstore figure out its business challenges and recommend solutions. 
The e-commerce retail industry breaks physical boundaries that reach millions of customers worldwide and has great growth potential. However, the e-commerce retail industry is highly competitive and global superstore need to gain competitive advantage. The main goal of this project is to help global superstore survive in this competitive market by reducing costs and increasing profitability. I break down the project into 3 parts, customer segmentation, cost analysis, and profit analysis. 
First, I cleaned and analyzed the dataset in SQL. Then I utilized RFM model in Python to conduct customer segmentation. Finally I viusalize the findings using 5 interactive Tableau dashboards and conducted profit and cost analysis.
